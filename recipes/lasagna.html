        of pasta, the word is a plural form. Lasagne meaning more than one piece of lasagna ribbon. The word also refers
        to a dish made with this type of pasta, in several layers interspersed with layers of ingredients and sauces.

    <p>The earliest lasagna recipes known are dated from the thirteenth century. At that time, tomatoes were not known
        to Europeans. This means that they couldnâ€™t have used them in the recipes. However, depending on the recipe,
        different cheeses are used.</p>
